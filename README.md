Table component
===============

This component aims to provide Html table generation from different kind of sources (Array, Doctrine Entity/Document), and is designed like the Symfony Form component is.

It allows for multiple filters on the same property, column sorting, pagination, batch actions, export and user profiles (saving/loading table configurations).
